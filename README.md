# Dunnart
Reference genome assembly of the Fat-tailed Dunnart ([*Sminthopsis crassicaudata*](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:86ab9ebf-cbd1-49f8-9786-312407738477), as part of an [Australian Biocommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) collaboration. Raw sequences were generated by Stephen Frankenberg (University of Melbourne) as part of the [Oz Mammals Genomics](https://ozmammalsgenomics.com/) (OMG) Framework Initiative, and downloaded from the Bioplatforms Australia data portal.
